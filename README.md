# Claude Course

This repo follows a course on Claude Code: [link](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant).

## Notes and Learnings
- `claude.md` is a file with instructions loaded into the model's context automatically.
- Claude does not index the code, it uses tools to navigate it and the model to reason.
- `uv run` both installs deps and runs the application.
- `init` command creates a `clade.md`. The course recommends starting with it.
